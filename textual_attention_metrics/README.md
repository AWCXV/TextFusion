## Textual Attention Metrics

### Usage
Run the following prompt on the Matlab platform (R2018b version is recommended)

```
main_evaluation
```

The metrics (.xlsx) will be saved in folder of the fusion results (from left to right: Qabf+, SSIM+, VIF+).

### Text confidence

We already provide the text confidence for three datasets , i.e., LLVIP, TNO, and RoadScene.

If you want to calculate the text confidence of your own dataset, please refer to the training [code](https://github.com/AWCXV/TextFusion-Association_for_Training) that generates the association map.
