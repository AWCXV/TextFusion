%This is an implementation of the algorithm for calculating the
%Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure (may also be known as the Sheikh
%-Bovik Index) between two images. Please refer
%to the following paper:
%
%H. R. Sheikh and A. C. Bovik "Image Information and Visual Quality"
%IEEE Transactios on Image Processing, in publication, May 2005.

%
%This implementation is slightly differnet from the one used to report
%results in the paper above. The modification have to do with using more
%subands than those used in the paper, better handling of image boundaries,
%and a window that automatically resizes itself based on the scale.

% Prerequisites: The Steerable Pyramid toolbox. Available at
% http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/software.html
%
%Input : (1) img1: The reference image
%        (2) img2: The distorted image (order is important)
%
%Output: (1) VIF te visual information fidelity measure between the two images

%Default Usage:
%   Given 2 test images img1 and img2, whose dynamic range is 0-255
%
%   vif = vifvec(img1, img2);
%
%Advanced Usage:
%   Users may want to modify the parameters in the code. 
%   (1) Modify sigma_nsq to find tune for your image dataset.
%   (2) MxM is the block size that denotes the size of a vector used in the
%   GSM model.
%   (3) subbands included in the computation
